## BDFD
Bot Designer For Discord is a free mobile app available on the App Store and Play Store.\
The app allows you to create Discord bots without much knowledge of established programming languages thanks to its unique language - BDScript, based on GoLang (DiscordGo library for Discord).\
You can find out more at [official website of Bot Designer For Discord](https://discordbotdesigner.com).

## Our Extension
Our extension brings in the features for comfortable coding your bot in BDScript.\
Lets gone through them quickly!

### Language
First of all, the extension brings in the new language support for VS Code:

### Syntax
The extension brings in the BDScript's syntax: the customizable highlighting of functions:

### Auto Completions
The extension will help you to type function names and will bring in the tabstops for functions' arguments.

### Helpers
The extension brings in the helpers aka the tools which can help you in some cases.\
One of them is Function List!\
You forgot the function's arguments? You're wondering if the function requires premium or intents, or maybe you just want to get function's description?\
This helper will answer your questions!

### Sync
I'd say it's the best feature that the extension brings in.\
It allows you to sync with BDFD which means you will be able to edit your commands, variables; create the new ones or delete the existing ones.\
Reading the [Sync Guide](./Sync%20Resources/SYNC.md) is required.

## Localization
Our extension's localization is made by our community.\
